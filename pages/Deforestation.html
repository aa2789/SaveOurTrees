    <h3 class="bold" style=" color:orange;margin-top:50px; text-align:center">What is Deforestation?</h3>
    <p class="changeWidth"> Deforestation refers to the destruction of trees through deliberate means for uses, such as
        agricultural croplands, urbanization, or mining activities. The loss of trees in the environment
        can lead to climate change, soil erosion, and increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
        The Food and Agriculture Organization estimates the annual rate of deforestation to be around 1.3 million km<sup>2</sup> per decade.
        The following list details the deleterious impact deforestation has on our environment.
    </p>
<h3 class="bold" style="color:orange; margin-top:50px;text-align:center"> Biodiversity </h3>
<p class="changeWidth "> Destroying trees can directly harm animals that may have built nests in them and change microclimates.
    Animals that heavily rely on trees may be unable to adapt to a new habitat, which in turn
    can cause them to become endangered. For example,  Indicator species, such as
    frogs that live in these forests, are highly sensitive to change and are at real
    risk of extinction as deforestation continues. In addition, deforestation can lead certain tree
    species to permanently disappear, which affects biodiversity of plant species in an environment.</p>

    <h3 class="bold" style="color:orange;margin-top:50px;text-align:center"> Increased Greenhouse Gases </h3>
    <p class="changeWidth ">
        In addition to habitat depletion, the absence of trees also allows for the release
        of more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Forests trap carbon dioxide, serving as valuable carbon sinks
        from the atmosphere. Therefore, deforested areas are lose their potential and release more biomass. This is
        very harmful and one of the leading contributors to rapid climate change.
    </p>
    <h3 class="bold" style="color:orange;margin-top:50px;text-align:center"> Soil Erosion and Flooding </h3>
    <p class="changeWidth ">
        Soil erosion and coastal flooding are further consequences of deforestation.
        Trees allow the land to retain water and topsoil, which provides additional forest life with rich nutrients.
        The soil erodes and washes off without forests, forcing farmers to move on and perpetuate the cycle.
        In the aftermath of these unsustainable agricultural activities,
        the barren land left behind is then more vulnerable to flooding, especially in coastal regions.
    </p>
    <h3 class="bold" style="color:orange;margin-top:50px;text-align:center"> Local People and Their Livelihoods </h3>
    <p style="margin-bottom:100px" class="changeWidth ">
        Healthy forests sustain the livelihoods of 1.6 billion people worldwide,
        of which one billion are among the poorest in the world. This implies that people rely on forests to survive
        and use them to hunt and harvest raw materials for their farming processes. This helps
        major corporations to purchase and use these lands for other purposes, destroying the lives of local citizens.
        Locals then must decide to leave their land and move elsewhere, accepting the challenge of a different life in a new way.
